# ----------------- Converting alignment to vcf -----------------

# After the alignment is complete, the genotype information needs to be converted into the more useful VCF format. 

# This was conducted in Annaconda Cloud (as the snp-sites package could not be installed locally). 

# list available conda environments
conda env list
  # "*" denotes the active environment

# Activate the new environment (or existing one)
`conda activate <environment_name>`

# Install snp-sites 
`conda install -c bioconda snp-sites`

# Upload fasta file to cloud terminal, then: 
# Run snp-sites (changing names as required)
`snp-sites -v -o snp_sites_msa_converted_09_2023.vcf aln_mafft_incRef_filtered_3_09_2023.fasta`
